**Week 1

Setup Github account and repositories

- Learn about Git & Github

Learn python concepts

- Creating and multiplying matrices via numpy

- Running specific for loops

- Matlab plotting

- Finding derivatives via approximation using the D1 matrix



**Week 2

Finding second derivatives via approximation using the D2 matrix

- Note how D2 = D1 * D1

- Eigenvalues for D2 are all between -4 and 0

Laid foundations for solving differential equations by noting the following facts

- y'(x) = D1 * y(x)

- y''(x) = D2 * y(x)

- (etc)
